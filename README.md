# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
I realized I messed something up with creating the version 0.1 in my first attempt at this project. I tried to salvage the work, but in the end couldn't troubleshoot it and just created a new Git Repository without including the version tag, so that I could at least demonstrate my Javascript abilities. I also was able to finish this now that the Adobe Connect lectures are available again.
